# SCA-Docs

This should be publicly accessible for anyone wanting the information. The SCA tends to be close-fisted and exclusive.

I did not author all of this content. The only content authored my me is the Barista and Brewing documents NOT written by the Specialty Coffee Association.

I do not take credit for any other content shown here. This is distributed for free educational use only.
